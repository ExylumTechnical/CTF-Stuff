This is a culmination of scripts I have used in the past for CTF competitions

## NCL - National Cyber Leauge<br>
### flag generate
Given a general patern of alphanumerics and symbols a script was written to generate a number of flags
### gpg log analysis
The challenge was to find a valid signature when given a bunch of gpg signed messages in a single file with a uniform format

## HTB - Hack the Box<br>
## OTW - Over the Wire<br>
## THM - Try hack me<br>
